"""PreToolUse guard (Write): stop a fresh Write from clobbering an
EXISTING live ledger that belongs to another session or a previous
task.

.workflow/ is shared, session-agnostic, and not git-tracked: nothing
stops a chair from `Write`-ing straight over a ledger a concurrent
session (or an earlier task in this same repo) is still tracking
state in — the tool has no notion of "this file already has content
I did not write." A Write is a full-file replace, unlike Edit's
surgical patch, so this is exactly the operation that destroys that
other task's ledger outright. This guard closes that gap the same
way the spawn/stop guards close the discovery gap: by refusing the
call, once, when it looks unowned.

DENY only when EVERY one of these holds:
    - the Write target already exists on disk (an in-place overwrite,
      not a brand-new ledger)
    - it is a live-named ledger (`_is_live_ledger_name`, the same
      filter `ledger_bind.py` and both spawn/stop guards use:
      "ledger" a whole leading segment, case-insensitive,
      *-archive.md/_archive.md excluded)
    - its parent directory is literally named `.workflow` (raw OR
      realpath parent, exactly like `ledger_bind.py` — a symlinked
      `.workflow/` must still count)
    - this session has a marker (an injected session), AND
    - the marker's `ledger` binding does not resolve to this exact
      path (`os.path.normcase(os.path.realpath(...))` on both sides —
      Windows paths are case-insensitive and may carry 8.3 short
      forms or drive-letter case differences that raw string
      comparison would miss)

ALLOW (return with no output) in every other case: the target does
not exist yet (this IS how a new ledger gets created); the session is
bound to exactly this path (continuing its own ledger via Write, e.g.
a full rewrite after heavy edits); there is no session marker at all
(manual install, or before this session's first SessionStart fire —
fail open rather than block on a signal we don't have); the target
is not a live ledger name or not under `.workflow/` (none of this
guard's business); or `LEDGER_WRITE_GUARD=0`.

No file is written or locked here — only read — so no fcntl is
needed, and the guard runs identically on macOS/Linux/Windows
(Git Bash `python3`, per the shim documented in ledger_guard_spawn.py
and friends).

Always exits 0. Every failure mode (malformed stdin, unreadable
marker, a realpath that raises, ...) is swallowed — this hook must
never block or fail a Write it can't fully reason about.

Configuration:
    LEDGER_WRITE_GUARD=0      disables this guard entirely
    FABLE_ORCH_METRICS=0      disables the local metrics log
