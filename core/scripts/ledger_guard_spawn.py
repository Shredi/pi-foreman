"""PreToolUse guard (Agent|Task|Workflow|TaskCreate): keep multi-phase work on the ledger.

Dynamic Workflow Rule 1: serious multi-phase delegation requires
this session's own Requirements Ledger in .workflow/ (see Binding
below; LEDGER*.md, *-archive.md excluded). Short spawn
prompts (quick searches/lookups) pass freely so casual Explore
agents are never blocked.

What is gated:
    Agent / Task  -> length of tool_input.prompt
    Workflow      -> length of tool_input.script (an orchestration
                     script IS the delegation plan; name/scriptPath
                     resume calls carry no new plan text and pass)
    TaskCreate    -> the SOLO path the spawn gates can't see: a chair
                     that never delegates never trips them, but the
                     tracker tasks it creates for itself are the tell.
                     The Nth TaskCreate of a session (default 3rd)
                     with no ledger draws ONE deny — "multi-phase
                     work: write the ledger, delegate to workers" —
                     then stays quiet (measured in the wild: a
                     6-phase plan implemented entirely on the chair).
Exempt:
    fork subagents (subagent_type == "fork") — a fork inherits the
    full conversation context, so the ledger is already in front
    of it; forcing a file adds nothing.

The threshold defaults to 1500 chars — strict on purpose. This
plugin is built for a premium chair (Fable, or Opus under either
opus profile), where even small delegations should carry a ledger:
chair tokens are the scarce resource, and detail loss at
task->plan translation is exactly what the ledger exists to catch.

Staleness: a ledger satisfies the gates unless it is STALE-COMPLETE —
every item closed AND untouched since before this session started
(session start read from the injector's marker). Without that rule,
last week's finished ledger would silence the gates in a repo forever.
A ledger with open items, or one touched this session, always
satisfies; without a marker (manual install) existence alone wins.

Binding, no fallback: with a session marker, ONLY the ledger this
session is bound to counts — bound by a Write/Edit/MultiEdit of it
(ledger_bind.py). An unbound session is denied even when other open
ledgers sit in .workflow/: those belong to other tasks, and there is no
adoption by discovery (03.10.2026: a fresh session adopted an ended
session's newest open ledger at its first spawn). Continuing an
existing ledger on purpose (resume, /clear, /spawn child) = Edit it
once, which binds. No marker under the plugin = unbound too; only a
manual install (no CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT) or no session id = legacy discovery.

Configuration (all optional):
    LEDGER_GUARD_THRESHOLD   gate in chars (default 1500; unparseable
                             values fall back to it, negatives clamp
                             to 0)
    LEDGER_GUARD_TASKS       deny fires AT the Nth ledgerless tracker
                             task (default 3 — two tasks pass free;
                             0 or negative disables the task gate)
    FABLE_ORCH_METRICS=0     disables the local metrics log
