"""PostToolUse hook (Write|Edit|MultiEdit): bind this session to the ledger it writes.

D1 (per-session ledger binding): the spawn/task/close guards used to
discover the "active" ledger by newest-mtime alone, with no session
dimension — two parallel sessions in the same repo would step on each
other's ledgers (session A's close held on session B's newer file, or
worse, silenced by it). The fix threads a per-session binding through
the injector's marker (`$TMPDIR/fable-orch-model-<sid>.json`, key
`"ledger"`), and this hook is its ONLY write point (03.10.2026: the spawn/task
gate's adoption-on-discovery was removed — it bound fresh sessions to
other tasks' open ledgers; the close guard never writes it). Editing
an existing ledger is therefore THE explicit way to continue it:

    a successful Write/Edit/MultiEdit whose target is the LIVE ledger
    in a `.workflow/` directory binds (or rebinds) this session to
    that exact path.

The live-name filter is the same one `active_ledger_in()` in both
guard scripts uses: `ledger[-._]*.md`, case-insensitive, "ledger" a
whole leading segment (not `ledgers.md`), *-archive.md/_archive.md
excluded. The parent directory must be literally named `.workflow` —
this hook does not walk upward like `find_ledger()`; a Write outside
that directory is not a ledger write.

No session marker: a manual install (no CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT) has nothing
to bind onto, so this hook does nothing; a plugin session whose marker
was swept gets a minimal one ({"started", "ledger"}) recreated, because
the gates treat it as unbound and it must be able to bind again. Every other file write, and every write whose
target is not a live ledger name, is a no-op too.

Always exits 0. Every failure mode (malformed stdin, unreadable
marker, permission error on the atomic replace, ...) is swallowed —
this hook must never block or fail a Write/Edit/MultiEdit.
