"""UserPromptSubmit guard: don't silently re-cache a huge, cold context.

MEASURED PROBLEM (audit of 4,238 chair messages, Aug 2026+): 99 messages
— 2.3% of the total — carried 66.1% of every cache-write token the chair
spent, and the first message after a >60-minute idle gap carried 51.4%
of them. Those are not "expensive turns"; they are FULL RE-CACHES. The
session sat in a terminal tab past the 1-hour prompt-cache TTL, the next
message found nothing warm, and the entire 300-800k context was written
again — at the 1h cache-write rate that is roughly 0.4 output tokens of
limit per context token, i.e. a single "quick question" costing more
than an hour of real work.

Why this hook and not SessionStart: the session never restarts. The tab
stays open across sleep/hibernate and the next prompt arrives hours
later in the SAME session, so SessionStart never fires again.
UserPromptSubmit is the only event on that path.

WHAT IT CANNOT KNOW. There is no API that reports prompt-cache state, so
this is a TIME HEURISTIC over the documented 1-hour TTL: idle longer than
FABLE_ORCH_COLD_MIN (default 55 min) is assumed cold. It can be wrong in
both directions — a warm cache blocked (one re-send costs 3 minutes of
patience) or a cold one missed (nothing worse than today).

BANDS, once the gap says "cold":

    ctx >= FABLE_ORCH_COLD_BLOCK_TOKENS (150k)  -> block, with the price
    ctx >= FABLE_ORCH_COLD_WARN_TOKENS  (50k)   -> systemMessage + context
    below                                       -> silent pass

A blocked prompt is never lost to the user: re-sending the same text
within FABLE_ORCH_COLD_ACK_MIN (3 min) passes through. `decision:
"block"` erases the prompt from the model's context but the message
tells the user exactly how to proceed, and Claude Code leaves the typed
text recoverable in the terminal.

FAIL-OPEN EVERYWHERE. Any unreadable payload, marker, or transcript, any
exception at all, means the prompt goes through. A cost guard that can
wedge a session is worse than the cost it saves.

ALWAYS PASSES, no matter how cold or how large:
  * prompts starting with "/" — `/clear` is this hook's own advice, and
    blocking `/exit` or `/compact` would trap the user in the guard
  * empty prompts, teammate sessions, FABLE_ORCH_COLD_GUARD=0

SKIPPED SILENTLY (no output, no marker write): submissions the harness
makes on its own — background task notifications, subagent hand-backs /
peer messages, local-command echoes, usage-limit and compaction notices.
Claude Code routes them through UserPromptSubmit like a typed prompt,
but no human is waiting on them, so a block would eat a worker's report
and a warning would nag about a cost nobody chose. See
`is_non_human_prompt`. The turn they trigger still ends in a Stop hook,
whose `last_stop` keeps the warmth baseline honest.
