"""SessionStart hook: inject the Dynamic Workflow instructions.

FABLE_ORCH_MODE=plain short-circuits all of this: one plain-mode line
is injected instead of a profile and the session marker is not written
(see `main`).

The plugin knows three chair profiles. The chair is detected per
session start and the matching profile injected:

    opus chair (detected)    -> dynamic-workflow-opus-primary.md
    FABLE_ORCH_PROFILE=opus  -> dynamic-workflow-opus.md
    anything else            -> dynamic-workflow-fable.md  (fable / unknown)

OPUS-PRIMARY is the default for an Opus chair: opus orchestrates and
plans, the fable tier is the REVIEWER — it reviews plans and verifies
every close, never plans or builds.
OPUS is the Fable-limit fallback — same discipline, the fable tier
rests entirely. Since the model string cannot tell "Opus by choice"
from "Opus because the Fable limit is spent", the fallback is reached
ONLY through the explicit pin; a detected opus model never selects it.

Detection, in priority order (first hit wins):

    1. FABLE_ORCH_PROFILE = fable | opus | opus-primary — explicit pin,
       overrides all (auto / unset / anything else falls through)
    2. the SessionStart payload's `model`  — authoritative for THIS
       session start, but the harness omits it on some resume/compact
       fires
    3. the user's configured default model in Claude Code settings.json
       — what `/model` persists, so it still tracks the chair when (2)
       is absent (the common "I switched to Opus but the payload was
       empty" case)
    4. the last model this session's marker saw — sticky fallback so a
       null-payload resume never regresses an opus session to fable
    5. fable — the safe default

Steps 2-4 only ever yield `opus-primary` or `fable`. The marker's
recorded PROFILE is not a detection input: a session pinned to the
fallback stays there exactly as long as the pin is set, and a resume
without it returns to OPUS-PRIMARY (via the switch delta below).

A mid-session /model switch still only takes visible effect at the next
session start (startup/resume/clear), because SessionStart is the sole
injection point — but (3) makes that next start reliable instead of
racy.

PROFILE-SWITCH DELTA. When a session that already received a core
profile re-fires with ANOTHER profile selected (the chair moved between
Fable and Opus, or the fallback pin was set or lifted), the full core is
NOT re-sent — it is already in context, and re-sending it spends the
very limit it exists to protect. A short switch note carries only the
deltas instead:

    any -> fable        -> profile-switch-to-fable.md
    any -> opus-primary -> profile-switch-to-opus-primary.md
    any -> opus         -> profile-switch-to-opus.md

The marker records the profile this session was last TOLD, so a plain
re-fire (same profile) is indistinguishable from before — it still gets
the full core. A marker with no recorded profile (a pre-0.15.0 marker,
or a session whose only fires were teammate skips) also gets the full
core: a delta is only ever safe on top of a core this session saw.

The delta is further gated to SessionStart `source == "resume"`, the
only fire that provably leaves the earlier injection in context.
`compact` fires precisely BECAUSE the context was rewritten, `clear`
because it was discarded, and a future source is simply unproven — all
three get the full core even when the profile changed. The switch note
says "every other rule from the already-injected core profile stays in
force", which is a lie the chair cannot detect if the core is gone.
It is also gated to an authoritative model signal (the payload model or
the env pin): the settings default is global and the marker model is
sticky history, so neither can prove THIS chair moved. And a fire that
delivers nothing (teammate skip, unreadable instructions) keeps the
recorded profile only on `resume`; any other fire clears it.

LEDGER REMINDER. On the two fires that can cost the chair its own
earlier reasoning — `compact` (the context was rewritten) and `resume`
(a transcript this model never thought through) — a session that
already carries a ledger binding gets one extra line after the profile,
naming that ledger's path. Fable 5.1 executes long horizons well but
only from what is in front of it; the file on disk is what survived.
Unbound sessions, startup/clear fires, and bindings whose file is gone
or archived get nothing.

TEAMMATE sessions are skipped entirely. Named agent-teams workers are
full claude sessions and fire SessionStart like the chair does — but the
profile is written for the chair alone: injected into a worker it says
"you are the ORCHESTRATOR" and invites it to spawn subagents, inverting
the very discipline the plugin enforces (measured in the wild: 172 of
270 injected sessions were teammates). Detection is the same ancestor
walk the stop guard uses (`--agent-id` on the nearest claude ancestor);
the session marker is still written so the other guards keep working.
FABLE_ORCH_TEAMMATE_INJECT=1 restores the old inject-everyone
behaviour.

The hook also maintains the per-session marker the Stop and SessionEnd
hooks rely on: its immutable `started` timestamp survives the re-runs
SessionStart gets on resume/clear/compact, and the stop guard compares
ledger mtimes against it to decide ownership.
